# $500 Ad Campaign Strategy
**split it. User Acquisition Plan**

---

## The Reality

With $500, expect **150-350 installs** from paid channels. The goal isn't scale—it's **validation + seed users who spread the word**.

Your best ROI comes from targeting people **actively searching for Splitwise alternatives**.

---

## Budget Allocation

| Channel | Budget | Expected Installs | CPI |
|---------|--------|-------------------|-----|
| Apple Search Ads | $300 | 150-200 | $1.50-$2.00 |
| Reddit Ads | $150 | 75-150 | $1.00-$2.00 |
| TikTok/Reddit Organic | $0 | Bonus | Free |
| **Total** | **$500** | **225-350** | |

**Skip Meta (Facebook/Instagram):** CPI is $3.50-$4.00. Too expensive for this budget.

---

## Channel 1: Apple Search Ads ($300)

**Why:** Lowest CPI (~$1.42 average), highest intent. Users are literally searching for expense apps.

### Setup

1. **Create Apple Search Ads account** at ads.apple.com
2. **Campaign type:** Search Results (not Search Tab)
3. **Daily budget:** $15/day for 20 days
4. **Bid strategy:** Cost-per-tap, start at $0.75

### Keyword Strategy

**Competitor Keywords (Exact Match):**
```
splitwise
splitwise alternative
tricount
splid
settle up
expense splitter
bill splitting app
split expenses
```

**Category Keywords (Exact Match):**
```
expense tracker
split bills
roommate expenses
trip expenses
group expenses
who owes who
```

### Pro Tips
- Set Search Match OFF (controls spend)
- Bid higher on "splitwise alternative" (high intent)
- Create custom product page highlighting "100% free" vs competitors
- Monitor daily; pause keywords with CPI > $3

---

## Channel 2: Reddit Ads ($150)

**Why:** Direct access to frustrated Splitwise users. Lowest CPC of major platforms ($0.50-$2.00).

### Setup

1. **Create Reddit Ads account** at ads.reddit.com
2. **Campaign objective:** App Installs
3. **Daily budget:** $10/day for 15 days
4. **Bid:** Start at $1.00 CPC

### Targeting

**Subreddits (Community Targeting):**
```
r/Splitwise (16K) - PRIMARY
r/Frugal (24M)
r/personalfinance (20M)
r/travel (10M)
r/backpacking (2M)
r/roommates (100K)
```

**Interest Targeting:**
- Personal Finance
- Budgeting
- Travel

### Ad Creative

**Format:** Image + Text (native feel)

**Headline Options:**
- "Splitwise hit the daily limit? Try this."
- "100% free expense splitting. No limits."
- "Just say your expense. We split it."

**Body:**
> Built split it. after Splitwise added the 3-expense limit. Unlimited expenses, voice input, no account needed. Free forever.

**CTA:** "Get the App"

### Pro Tips
- Match subreddit tone (casual, not corporate)
- Run r/Splitwise ads on weekends (trip planning time)
- A/B test: "free" angle vs "voice" angle

---

## Channel 3: Free Organic ($0)

Don't spend money here—invest time instead.

### Reddit Posts (Free)

Post in r/Splitwise when:
- Someone complains about limits (happens weekly)
- Someone asks for alternatives
- New month starts (people settling up)

**Template:**
```
Hey, I built a free alternative after hitting the same wall.
- Unlimited expenses
- Receipt scanning (snap a photo, we extract items)
- No limits, no subscriptions

[Link]. Would love feedback.
```

> **Note:** Update template to include voice input once that feature ships.

### TikTok (Free)

Record 3 videos:
1. **Hook:** "Splitwise charges $40/year for THIS?" (show limit popup)
2. **Demo:** Receipt scanning in action (snap photo → items extracted → friends claim)
3. **Relatable:** "POV: Splitting the Airbnb with 6 people"

Post organically first. If one takes off, boost it.

> **Future:** Add voice expense entry demos once that feature ships.

## Timing & Execution

### Week 1-2: Apple Search Ads
- Launch competitor keyword campaign
- Spend $150 ($10-15/day)
- Optimize: pause high-CPI keywords

### Week 2-3: Reddit Ads
- Launch r/Splitwise + r/Frugal targeting
- Spend $100 ($10/day)
- Test 2 ad creatives

### Week 3-4: Optimize & Extend
- Double down on winning channel
- Spend remaining $250
- Post organic Reddit/TikTok content

---

## Tracking

### Must Track
- **Installs by source** (use AppsFlyer free tier or adjust)
- **Cost per install** by keyword/subreddit
- **Day 1 retention** (did they create a group?)

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Total installs | 250+ |
| Avg CPI | < $2.00 |
| Groups created | 100+ |
| Day 7 retention | 20%+ |

## What $500 Can't Do

Be realistic:
- Won't get you to 10K users
- Won't make you viral
- Won't validate product-market fit alone

**What it CAN do:**
- Get 250+ targeted users who wanted an alternative
- Generate first reviews (ask happy users!)
- Test which messaging resonates
- Seed the referral loop (each user invites friends)

---

## After the $500

If CPI < $2 and retention > 20%:
- Consider $2K/month on Apple Search Ads
- Scale Reddit to more subreddits
- Test TikTok Spark Ads (boost organic hits)

If CPI > $3 or retention < 10%:
- Pause paid, focus on product
- Double down on organic Reddit/TikTok
- Revisit after voice feature ships
